                <p>A Benjes hedge is a simple way to provide wildlife in your garden with a natural habitat. The hedge is made up of cut branches and twigs stacked in a rectangle. It's amazing how many animals can use such a hedge as a hiding place and a home.</p><p>The Benjes hedge provides a home for numerous animals. Birds can nest in the branches, and insects find shelter in the hollow spaces. Mammals such as hedgehogs, mice, and squirrels use the hedge as a hiding place and a home. The Benjes hedge is also an important habitat for butterflies and other insects that are essential for pollinating plants.</p><p>A Benjes hedge is an excellent habitat for birds. The branches and twigs provide them with protection from the wind and rain and are the perfect place to build a nest. In spring and summer, you can hear the birdsong of those that have settled in the hedge. When the young hatch, you can witness the wonder of growing up up close.</p>
